Hi PhonePe Support Team,

Greetings from People Enterprises!

Thank you for reviewing our application. We appreciate your feedback and would like to address each of the points you've raised:

**1. Login Credentials**

We apologize for the confusion regarding the login credentials. Please find the correct credentials below:

- **Phone Number:** +919009009000
- **OTP:** 909090

These credentials are for the Freelancer account and should allow you to access the application successfully. Please let us know if you encounter any issues with these credentials.

**2. Pricing Information**

We understand your concern regarding pricing information. We would like to clarify that our application operates on a unique marketplace model where **clients set their own prices for the work they need done**. 

Here's how our pricing model works:
- Clients post jobs with their own budget/price
- Freelancers can view these jobs and either accept the client's price or make counter-offers
- There is no fixed pricing structure because each job is unique and priced individually by the client
- The platform acts as a middleman/aggregator connecting clients with freelancers, similar to other marketplace platforms

This is an intentional design choice that allows for flexibility and competitive pricing based on market demand. The pricing is clearly visible on each job posting, and clients have full control over setting their budgets.

**3. Application Development Status**

We have addressed the issue you mentioned regarding the "Help & Support" section. The application is now fully functional with complete Help & Support content including:
- Comprehensive support information
- Contact details (Email: rohanjaiswar2467@gmail.com, Phone: +91 7021098460)
- FAQ section
- Account management guidance
- Technical support information

The Help & Support page is now fully operational and accessible from the Settings menu. We have also completed all other features and the application is ready for production use.

**Additional Information:**

- **App Name:** People
- **Platform:** Android
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Package:** com.company.people

We have recently built a new standalone production APK that includes all the latest updates and fixes. The application is fully functional and ready for integration with PhonePe Payment Gateway.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,
People Enterprises Team

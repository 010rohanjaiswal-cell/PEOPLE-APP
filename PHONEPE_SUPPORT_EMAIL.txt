Subject: Request to Enable SDK Orders - 500 Error on SDK Order Creation - Merchant ID: M23OKIGC1N363

Dear PhonePe Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with enabling SDK orders for our merchant account. We are experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error when attempting to create SDK orders through the PhonePe Payment Gateway API.

MERCHANT DETAILS:
- Merchant ID: M23OKIGC1N363
- Environment: Production
- Integration Type: Android Native SDK (React Native)

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
We are trying to integrate PhonePe Native SDK for in-app payments in our Android application. However, when we attempt to create an SDK order using the /checkout/v2/sdk/order endpoint, we receive a 500 Internal Server Error from PhonePe's servers.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

API Endpoint: POST https://api.phonepe.com/apis/pg/checkout/v2/sdk/order

Request Headers:
- Content-Type: application/json
- Authorization: O-Bearer <access_token>

Request Body:
{
  "merchantId": "M23OKIGC1N363",
  "merchantOrderId": "DUES_TEST_17661244003N",
  "amount": 100,
  "merchantUserId": "test_user",
  "redirectUrl": "people-app://payment/callback?orderId=DUES_TEST_17661244003N",
  "redirectMode": "REDIRECT",
  "callbackUrl": "https://freelancing-platform-backend-backup.onrender.com/api/payment/webhook",
  "paymentFlow": "SDK",
  "paymentInstrument": {
    "type": "UPI_INTENT"
  },
  "expireAfter": 1200
}

Error Response:
{
  "success": false,
  "code": "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR",
  "message": "There is an error trying to process your transaction at the moment. Please try again in a while.",
  "data": {}
}

HTTP Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error

WHAT WE'VE VERIFIED:
✓ Authorization Token: Successfully generated and validated
✓ Request Format: Matches PhonePe SDK documentation
✓ All Required Fields: Present in request body
✓ Headers: Properly formatted with O-Bearer token
✓ Merchant ID: Valid and active

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
According to PhonePe SDK documentation, a successful SDK order creation should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "orderToken": "hq4wOGdzX31IuPyyh7/7...",
    "orderId": "OMO2403282020198641071317"
  }
}

REQUEST:
We believe this error indicates that SDK orders are not enabled for our merchant account. We would like to request:

1. Enable SDK orders for merchant account M23OKIGC1N363
2. Verify merchant account configuration supports SDK order flow
3. Confirm if any additional setup or approval is required

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
- Integration Type: Android Native SDK (React Native)
- SDK Package: react-native-phonepe-pg (version 2.0.2)
- Payment Flow: SDK Order Flow (paymentFlow: "SDK")
- Payment Instrument: UPI_INTENT

DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE:
We are following the official PhonePe documentation:
- Android SDK Integration: https://developer.phonepe.com/payment-gateway/mobile-app-integration/standard-checkout-mobile/android-sdk
- SDK Order API: https://developer.phonepe.com/payment-gateway/mobile-app-integration/standard-checkout-mobile/api-reference/create-payment
